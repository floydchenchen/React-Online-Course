# Section 3: Modeling Application State
## What is Redux?
* Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. (**a collection of all the data that describes the app**, that not only includes hard data but also includes meta level properties(like currently-selected book))
* **Redux is the data contained inside the application box, where as React is the views contained inside the application box**
* The characteristics of Redux: **All data are centralized inside a single object ==> state**.
* state is redux is application level state, which is different from component level state.
