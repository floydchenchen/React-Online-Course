# Lesson 05: Data Driven Components

## Props
* React allows us to send data to a component in the same syntax as HTML, using **attributes** or **properties** on a component
* We can think about the property of the `<img/>` tag as a `prop` we are setting on a component called `img`.
* We can access these properties inside a component as `this.props`.
