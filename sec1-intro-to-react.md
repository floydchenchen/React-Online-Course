## JSX
```JavaScript
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

* This funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML.
* It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript.

### component / view
* definition: snippets of code that produce HTML

* rule: we always make one component per file

## class-based components
* functional component: create a component with a function

```JavaScript
return (
    <div>
        <SearchBar />
    </div>
);
```

* class component: internal record-keeping feature

```
class SearchBar extends Component{
    render() {
        return <input />;
    }
}
```

## Handling User Events
two steps to handling user events:

* declare a event handler
* pass the event handler to the element that we want to monitor for events
